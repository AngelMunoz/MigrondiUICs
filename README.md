# Migrondi UI

Migrondi is in the beta stage at the moment and I intend it to be able to use it as a library.

So this project is precisely to test the ergonomics and usefulness of that library.

Migrondi as the CLI works just fine and under that context there are no issues but outside that things may not be so simple.

This project is to test that.
